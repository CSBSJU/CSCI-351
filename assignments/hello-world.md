# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is two-fold:
1. to become familiar with the process for accessing course materials, including
   starter code for future assignments and
1. to become familiar with the process for building and executing simple C
   programs.

# Preliminaries
Follow the instructions found [here]({{ site.canvas.prefix }}/courses/{{
site.canvas.course }}/pages/howto-assignments) to access the starter code for
this assignment. The repository to fork is
[https://github.com/CSBSJU/CSCI-351-hello-world.git](https://github.com/CSBSJU/CSCI-351-hello-world.git).

# Part 1
Get the code to compile without any errors. Then run the executable that was
generated. When done correctly, the program will display instructions for
submitting your solution.
