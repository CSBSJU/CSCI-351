## Accessing an assignment
1. Go to the link for the assignment provided to you by your instructor.
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. After cloning the repository to your computer, change to the directory
   that was created and execute the following command
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CSBSJU/<repo>
```


## Working on an assignment
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to create a history of
   the work that you have completed.
1. At any time, you may [**push**][ref-push]/sync your changes to GitHub. This
   is a good idea for two reasons:
   1. [GitHub **issues**][issue] are the preferred way to solicit help from your
      instructor.
   1. Changes become permanent -- even if your computer crashes, your work will
      not be lost.

## Submitting an assignment
1. [**Commit**][ref-commit] your final solution, if you have made any changes
   since your last commit.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync your changes up to GitHub if you have not done so
   already.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] by going to the link
```
https://github.com/CSBSJU/<repo>/compare/base...master
```
   `<repo>` should be replaced with the name of the repository that you cloned
   in step 2 under [Accessing an assignment](#accessing-an-assignment).
