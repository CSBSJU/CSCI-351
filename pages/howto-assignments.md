title: "HOWTO: assignments"

## Accessing an assignment
1. Go to the link for the assignment provided to you by your instructor.
1. [**Fork**][ref-fork] the repository to your GitHub account.
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.

## Working on an assignment
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to create a history of
   the work that you have completed.
1. At any time, you may [**push**][ref-push]/sync your changes to GitHub. This
   is a good idea for two reasons:
   1. [GitHub **issues**][issue] are a convenient way to solicit help from your
      instructor.
   1. Changes become permanent -- even if your computer crashes, your work will
      not be lost.
